This first Codecademy FSE Course is Web Development Foundations.
One thing that makes this course special is that I'm swinging to knock this course out this week.

Future weeks will have side quests to enhance the learning experience, like Signal Code to enhance PostgreSQL material in Course 4, but this week's lessons look straightforward, so let's put this one in the books.

One habit I'm emphasizing this week is attention to detail, evidenced in the syllabus above, and the following quote found on a markdown resource that spoke to me: 

![A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.

I'm super new here, and to #100DOC, and would like to meet others and hear your stories, so feel free to drop a link or share!

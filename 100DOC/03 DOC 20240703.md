Little distraction with mom losing email access yesterday, took a bit of effort, but was able to resolve with best possible solution.

Currently working on CSS Selectors in CSS Fundamentals lesson, which I've seen before, so wanting to see how far I can move today.

My attainable aim this week is to complete Web Dev Foundations:
Fundamentals of HTML (done)
Fundamentals of CSS (in progress)
Developing Websites Locally
Deploying Websites
Improved Styling with CSS
Making a Website Responsive

Then review and complete the 2 Web Dev Foundations assessments, first: question/answer and second: coding, over the weekend, this being a 100 Day of Code challenge, so coding weekends, haha.

Next week is going to be oh so much more fun(!), starting with JavaScript, which I've been anticipating for so long that I cannot begin to describe.

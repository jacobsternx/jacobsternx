The Codecademy Developing Websites Locally lesson is mainly about getting comfortable with locally sourced dev tools, which was good review. 

As an aside, my VS Code time tracking extension CodeTime looks to be working nicely; 6 hrs 18 mins today.

Being the weekend, I caught up with my mom, who's well, and with a friend about our Suns basketball prospects, and fitting in a Diamondbacks game or two. With Phoenix, AZ, July weather forecast 115Â°F for the next week, I'm sticking to indoor fitness.

This leaves 3 lessons to finish the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course:
Deploying Websites
Improved Styling with CSS
Making a Website Responsive

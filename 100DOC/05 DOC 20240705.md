Yesterday being Independence Day, I took some time off to catch up with family and friends. Last night's Phoenix AZ skies were crystal clear for a spectacular view of fireworks.

Codecademy certainly covers CSS thoroughly; I definitely noted that element positioning is thoroughly explored, including Z-Index and floats, which I understand used to be common, and many of us will be responsible for maintaining existing code bases, so it's good to see it now.

Onto next lesson, Deploying Websites Locally, and seeing what that brings.

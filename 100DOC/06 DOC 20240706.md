Yesterday I spent reviewing CSS and CSS projects. CSS seems an important base to be able to later employ media queries and React to structure HTML.

I looked at a couple VS Code time tracking extensions, but most of my time is spent in the browser, so I'll review this later, but CodeTime has some nice features, including nice summary and data visualizations, all data is kept indefinitely with full control, and there's a free level. However, there were some issues initializing the API token, so I'll call it a beta release. If anyone has a good experience either using an extension for VS Code and Chrome to track your coding time, or another approach, please share in the comments!

My remaining lessons for Codecademy Web Dev Foundations course:
Developing Websites Locally
Deploying Websites
Improved Styling with CSS
Making a Website Responsive

While these lessons look attainable, I'm unfamiliar with their material, so I'll target one lesson per day and see how quickly I can move on to the second Codecademy course, Building Interactive Websites, starting with JavaScript. Back to it now.

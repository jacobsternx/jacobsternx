First, Happy Birthday USA!

While I got most of the way through the CSS lesson, it's the biggest lesson in the Web Dev Foundations course and I still some CSS to go. One thing I really like about Codecademy is how thorough, accurate, and complete it is, although sometimes tedious. Only interesting CSS part is the "box-sizing: border-box" model, which I'd seen but was told was rarely used.

In contrast with the default "box-sizing: content-box" model, border-box includes padding and border within element dimensions, which is meant to simplify calculating sizes of complex nested elements. Note: this changes the calculated height and width of elements with padding or borders.

box-sizing: content-box vs border-box

After CSS articles, videos, and projects, onto websites! My most-anticipated Javascript lesson target date is Mon Jul 8, 2024.

I really appreciate those who reached out. Devs have been super kind and supportive, and I aim to pay that forward. I found a word to describe us: Tribe mates. I like it!

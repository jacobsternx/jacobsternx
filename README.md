## About me

Hi, I'm Jacob. Don't believe it, but sometimes I pretend to be able to golf.

My interests include fitness, good food, and the Phoenix Suns.

Here are some languages I'm learning:
| Rank | Languages       |
|-----:|-----------------|
|     1| Javascript      |
|     4| HTML+CSS        |
|     3| SQL             |
|     2| git             |
|     5| tools/libraries |
